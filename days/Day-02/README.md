# 30 Days of n8n – Real Automation Use Cases

This repository documents a personal challenge:
**30 days, 30 real-world automations built with n8n.**

The goal is simple:
identify small, everyday tasks that are still done manually  
and replace them with practical, reusable automations.

This is **not a course** and **not a tutorial series**.
It’s an open, hands-on process focused on real use cases.
